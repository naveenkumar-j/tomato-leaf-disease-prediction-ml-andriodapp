## About Project:
Today, the technology is used in every aspect of life. Farmers are facing
difficulties in manually identifying the tomato leaf diseases in plants. Also, expert
advice is not available easily to the farmers. It is beneficiary to have an automated
mechanism to identify the tomato leaf diseases. The proposed method used
machine learning techniques to detect the tomato leaf diseases in plants.

## Motivation:
Tomato Plant diseases are the common reason for low yield and reduced income to
the farmers. Currently,researchers are trying their best to find a mechanism that
automatically detects the tomato leaf diseases.Accurate identification of tomato
leaf diseases may help in finding a remedy at the earliest to control the
loss. Our project attempts to develop a novel approach by using machine learning
techniques to predict the tomato leaf diseases.
